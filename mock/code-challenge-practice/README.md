# Mock Code Challenge

In a real code challenge, this `README` would describe and provide the
instructions for the challenge.

As this is a mock challenge, meant to give you practice in the process, the
instructions for this will be simple.

## Instructions

1. Make sure you are in the `code-challenge-practice` folder.
1. Create a file called `your-name.md`.

That's all! Return to the instructions on the main lesson for steps on how to
save and turn in your work.
